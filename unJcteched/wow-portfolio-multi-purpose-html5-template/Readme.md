- Pelican is installed in the rood directory.

- the themes folder contain themes for conversion.

- when you convert one please do a pull request to merge it to this repo.

- specify your theme folder in the pelicanconf.py

- use only one instance of pelican .

- use pipenv install so that the dependencies and pelican 4.7.1 is installed as well as invoke markdown and livereload

- I plan to do some python scripting to populate each fo the folders with the pelcan simple theme template files.



-  please log here which theme you have started and finished converting
