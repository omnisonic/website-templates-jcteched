- This Repo is to aid in the rapid theme conversion and website building by jctech.

- Pelican is installed in the rood directory.

- the themes folder contain themes for conversion.

- when you convert one please do a pull request to merge it to this repo.

- specify your theme folder in the pelicanconf.py

- use only one instance of pelican .

- use pipenv install so that the dependencies and pelican 4.7.1 is installed as well as invoke markdown and livereload

- I plan to do some python scripting to populate each fo the folders with the pelcan simple theme template files.



-  please log here which theme you have started and finished converting

- please also move the theme to the jcteched folder when converted

- OUTPUT_PATH = '<the_theme_name_here>' in pelicanconf to match the theme name.  pelican will create a new folder for the output by that name.  I might want to put this output into the theme folder as well but I am not sure depend on if we can publish to amplify that way or not.
